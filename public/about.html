    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      Hi, I'm Jonna Grace D. Rosal, currently a full-time mom and housewife living in Brgy. Pusok, Lapu-Lapu City, Philippines. I have a strong background in finance, having previously worked as an Account Officer, Bank Teller, Loan Administrative Assistant, and Bank Bookkeeper. I hold a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration with a major in Financial Management from Western Leyte College of Ormoc.
    </p>

    <p>
      Throughout my career, I've developed skills in bank telling and bookkeeping, with a deep understanding of basic accounting principles. My expertise includes data entry, account reconciliation, and a high level of accuracy in financial reporting. I am proficient in Microsoft Excel and have a keen attention to detail, which has helped me excel in maintaining professionalism and organization in all my tasks.
    </p>

    <p>
      Outside of my professional life, I am fascinated by astronomyâ€”particularly topics related to Kepler. I enjoy capturing the beauty of nature through photography and have a keen interest in playing tennis. I also aspire to learn underwater diving someday, as I am always eager to explore new adventures.
    </p>

    <p>
      In terms of personal goals, my short-term aim is to learn full-stack web development, which I believe will open up new opportunities for me in the digital world. Long-term, I dream of traveling the world with my husband, capturing the breathtaking wonders of our planet. Achieving financial freedom and owning homes for my family and parents are also among my top priorities.
    </p>

    <p>
      My personal motto is: "Fight your battles with sincere prayers because all battles are won in prayer." This belief guides me through life's challenges, providing me with strength and perseverance.
